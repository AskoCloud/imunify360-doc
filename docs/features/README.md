# Imunify360 Features

## RapidScan

We're making anti-malware and antivirus scans faster with RapidScan, the scanning option for Imunify360.

Quicker scans mean lower system resource usage, and an opportunity to scan more frequently, further hardening your systems’ security posture.

Here's a short summary of how we've managed to get these impressive performance increases.

* **Faster File Integrity Checking**. File metadata, such as file hashes, are now stored locally. This means that unchanged files don't need to be rescanned, and no need to schedule complete scans for quiet times of the day.
* **Efficient Cloud-assisted Scanning**. Imunify360 stores its malicious file hash database in the cloud. Malicious files are detected first—white-listed files are skipped. The remaining files are fewer, so the overall scan time is significantly reduced.
* **Optimized Malware Signatures**. Our malware signature database continually expands to match the ever-growing diversity and variety of malicious software. While the database becomes more accurate and comprehensive, it also becomes larger and more cumbersome to index. We tackle this by actively curating the database and re-evaluating complex signatures, recasting any that affect scanning performance.
 
#### What does it mean to you?

When you first enable the RapidScan feature, the first scan will run as before. But subsequent scans will see a dramatic speed improvement, anywhere between 5 to 20 times faster. This is the case for both on-demand and scheduled scans, and means you can afford more scans without affecting system performance. More scans mean safer systems.

To take advantage of these new improvements, go to your Imunify control panel and enable RapidScan in Settings→Malware Scanner. See details [here](/dashboard/#malware).
